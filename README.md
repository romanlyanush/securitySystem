This is a rather ridiculous security program called Travis is going to have a list of known users and every time it runs – it’s going to
ask for your name. If you are in the list of known users – it will welcome you and ask you if you would like to be removed from the list.
How sweet is that! And if the security system does not recognize you – it will ask you if you would like to be added to the list.
Now, this might be both the most polite and ridiculous security ever built, but it will let me illustrate how to do some pretty cool things
with python lists.
